# [Project 1: House Price Prediction using Advance Regression](https://github.com/Anilbiradar014/House-Price-Prediction-Using-Advance-Regression/blob/main/README.md)
Aim of the project is to know the following things about the prospective properties:<br/>
1 Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and<br/>
2 How well those variables describe the price of a house
+ Feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination 
+ Building the Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression models.
+ Hyperparameter tuning and selecting the best model based on RMSE and R-squared value.


# [Project 2: Forecast-the-number-of-passengers-for-the-next-twelve-months](https://github.com/Anilbiradar014/Forecast-the-number-of-passengers-for-the-next-twelve-months)

With the data on the number of passengers that have travelled with the airline on a particular route for the past few years. Using this data, want to forecast the number of passengers for the next twelve months.

+ To capture the level, trend and seasonality in the time series with different smoothing techniques.
+ Also build the different Auto-Regressive Models (ARIMA, ARMIAX, SARIMA, SARIMAX)
+ Selecting the best model based on RMSE and MAPE.
