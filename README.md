# [Project 1: House Price Prediction using Advance Regression](https://github.com/Anilbiradar014/House-Price-Prediction-Using-Advance-Regression/blob/main/README.md)
Aim of the project is to know the following things about the prospective properties:<br/>
1 Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and<br/>
2 How well those variables describe the price of a house
+ Feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination 
+ Building the Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression models.
+ Hyperparameter tuning and selecting the best model based on RMSE and R-squared value.

# [Project 2: Forecast the number of passengers for the next twelve months](https://github.com/Anilbiradar014/Forecast-the-number-of-passengers-for-the-next-twelve-months)

With the data on the number of passengers that have travelled with the airline on a particular route for the past few years. Using this data, want to forecast the number of passengers for the next twelve months.

+ To capture the level, trend and seasonality in the time series with different smoothing techniques.
+ Also build the different Auto-Regressive Models (ARIMA, ARMIAX, SARIMA, SARIMAX)
+ Selecting the best model based on RMSE and MAPE.

# [Project 3: Choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid](https://github.com/Anilbiradar014/choosing-the-countries-that-are-in-the-direst-need-of-aid.)
Aim of the project is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors and need to suggest the countries which needs to focus on the most.
* Using Hopkins Statistics to find whether data points have high tendency of cluster.
* Tuning optimal number of clusters using KMEANS clustering 
* Finding the optimal number of clusters using Hierarchical Clustering

# [Project 4: Covid 19 Dashboard](https://github.com/Anilbiradar014/Covid-19-Dashboard-R-Shiny) - [Live](https://anilbiradar.shinyapps.io/Covid19Dashboard/)
* The R shiny app is built to view the interactive visualisation for cumulative COVID-19 cases and the three-machine learning model output. 
* This graphs allows you to understand the way the COVID-19 cases have increased across the globe along with time.

# [Project 5:Mobile Price Prediction]()
This Study aims at accurately predicting in what price range a particular mobile falls into , by fitting the data into five classifiers (K-NearestNeighbour, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Support Vector Machine Classifier) and identify the best classifier with highest accuracy.
